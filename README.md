# Zoom Adapter PHP

## Introduction

Zoom Adapter PHP is an easy-to-use PHP adapter for programmatically accessing and manipulating Zoom meetings, webinars, and rooms in your custom PHP application. The adapter provides a level of abstraction above the official [Zoom API](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/api-reference/introduction), and aims to make it easy to integrate Zoom. It is definitely a working progress, so I welcome contributions towards development.

## Zoom API Support

Currently, the Zoom Adapter in PHP partially supports the following features:

- Zoom Meetings
- Zoom Webinars
- Zoom Rooms
